To help document the role and response of tropical forests in a global change context, IRD has been collaborating since 2010 with local institutions in Cameroon, Gabon and DRC to set up a network (or observatory) of permanent forest inventory scientific plots. 

  
__*Data acquisition__* follows international methodological standards to measure above-ground biomass and inventory tree species within 1 ha square plots. 

   
__*Taxa identification__* is conducted through the following steps:
Experiment field botanists conduct a first identification on the field. When possible, herbarium samples are collected for (i) each species of a plot present and (ii) all unidentified, or uncertain identification, individuals.
Herbarium samples are collected in at least two duplicates. One stay in the host country while another is stored at a unique dedicated herbarium collection for tree inventory in Central Africa at the Herbarium of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium) (BRLU).

  
A particular attention is given to the quality of __*plot georeferencing__* with the prospect of remote sensing product calibration/validation. Sampling of plot location is oriented towards representative forest types, and not fully random. It is therefore more suitable in a model-based statistical framework than in a design-based one.
In terms of scientific output, parts of the plot network has already been used in ecological and remote sensing studies.
